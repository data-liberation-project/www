On March 27, 2023, the [Data Liberation Project](https://www.data-liberation-project.org/) (in collaboration with [Marc DaCosta](https://marcdacosta.com/about/index.html)) sent the Department of Labor [a request](https://www.data-liberation-project.org/requests/dol-file-plans-and-eis-listings/) for two categories of records:

- All "[file plans](https://www.archives.gov/files/records-mgmt/training/material/l1-008/index.html#/lessons/MdHIahEUzvo9gH9BpfVYtucnIwlP9AFc)," which describe the kinds of records a government agency holds and how/where they're stored.
- All "[electronic information system](https://www.archives.gov/records-mgmt/scheduling/inventory-systems) listings," a similar concept but specific to databases.

On June 15, 2023, the DOL sent us a set of files, accompanied by a [determination letter regarding the request](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23866900-2023-06-15-foia-f-08834-signed).

In all, after un-zipping the files, there appear to be **425 documents**. By format: 236 Microsoft Word files, 99 Excel files, 70 PDF files, 13 `.msg` files, and 7 `.rtf` files. (Note: Some of the files are duplicates or near-duplicates of one another.)

The Data Liberation Project is making the files available to all. You can access them in two ways:

- As [folders](https://dlp-cdn.muckrock.com/DOL%20File%20Plans%20and%20EIS%20Listings/index.html), available to download in bulk
- As a [project on DocumentCloud](https://www.documentcloud.org/app?q=+project:dol-file-plans-and-eis-li-213626%20), where you can search across all records (excluding the 13 `.msg` files)

To help organize the files, the Data Liberation Project has also created a [spreadsheet listing them](https://dlp-cdn.muckrock.com/DOL%20File%20Plans%20and%20EIS%20Listings/Records%20Provided%20via%20DOL%20FOIA%202023-F-08834.xlsx), indicating their:

- Directory
- Filename
- Extension (e.g., `.xlsx`)
- Size (in kilobytes)
- Subagency for which the file was created
- Category of record (file plan, electronic information listing, etc.)
- Brief notes from the Data Liberation Project, clarifying the file's purpose/contents

The most recent files appear to have been created in late 2019 / early 2020. "DOL has not created any new files plans or EIS listings since those dates," according to the Department of Labor's FOIA coordinator for this request, in follow-up correspondence with the Data Liberation Project.

Most of the files are specific to a subagency (such as the [Wage and Hour Division](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd)), sub-subagency, or field office.
