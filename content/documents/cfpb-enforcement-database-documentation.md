summary: A six-page document describing the structure of `ENForce`, CFPB's “enforcement matter management system.”

---

One of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s key roles is to [investigate and enforce](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/enforcement/life-cycle-of-enforcement-action/) potential violations of federal consumer finance laws. To track and organize those efforts, the CFPB uses an “enforcement matter management system” called `ENForce`.

In response to [our FOIA request for documentation of such systems](../requests/cfpb-enforcement-database-documentation/), the CFPB sent the Data Liberation Project a [six-page document](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23777876-2023-04-14-cfpb-2023-0206-f-binder) that describes some of `ENForce`'s structure.

The document includes:

- A diagram of the database's data model
- The database's entity relationship diagram
- A table "list all Standard and Custom objects used to support the application"

The title page also indicates that `ENForce` is a Salesforce-powered application.
