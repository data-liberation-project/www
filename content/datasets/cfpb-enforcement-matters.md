summary: Amounts and dates of court-ordered relief and penalties in Consumer Financial Protection Bureau enforcement matters.

---

One of the [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/)’s key roles is to [investigate and enforce](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/enforcement/life-cycle-of-enforcement-action/) potential violations of federal consumer finance laws. To track and organize those efforts, the CFPB uses an “enforcement matter management system” called ENForce. 

On May 30, 2023, the [Data Liberation Project](https://www.data-liberation-project.org) filed a [FOIA request for detailed tables from that system](https://www.data-liberation-project.org/requests/cfpb-enforcement-matters/). On September 18, 2023, the agency provided a [single spreadsheet](https://dlp-cdn.muckrock.com/CFPB%20Enforcement%20Matters%20Data/CFPB-2023-0365-F%20Records%20Provided%202023-09-18/index.html) in response, listing the amounts and dates of court-ordered relief and penalties in those enforcement matters.

Although the Data Liberation Project plans to appeal the agency’s response, we are [providing the spreadsheet now](https://dlp-cdn.muckrock.com/CFPB%20Enforcement%20Matters%20Data/CFPB-2023-0365-F%20Records%20Provided%202023-09-18/index.html), along with [DLP-written documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15TI4q6oHeQzIUsiq-635xaMwTay6Kp0lQ0IWxiSsYiw/edit?tab=t.0), so that the public can make use of it.
