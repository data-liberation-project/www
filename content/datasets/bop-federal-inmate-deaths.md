On August 8, 2024, the Data Liberation Project [filed a FOIA request](https://www.data-liberation-project.org/requests/bop-federal-inmate-deaths/) to the Bureau of Prisons seeking data records representing each federal inmate death since 2005. 

September 4, 2024, the agency [responded to the request 📄](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25141895-2024-09-04-determination-letter) and provided a [spreadsheet](https://dlp-cdn.muckrock.com/BOP%20Inmate%20Deaths/Records%20Received%202024-09/index.html) with most of what we requested.

The [spreadsheet](https://dlp-cdn.muckrock.com/BOP%20Inmate%20Deaths/Records%20Received%202024-09/index.html) contains 8,242 entries, each representing a deceased inmate. It contains the following columns:

- `RegisterNum`: [BOP Register Number](https://www.bop.gov/inmateloc/)
- `NameLast`: Last name; no first names provided
- `Sex`: Either "Female" or "Male"
- `Race`: Either "Asian", "Black", "Black-Hispanic", "Native American", "White", "White-Hispanic",  "Unknown", or "Other"
- `DOD`: Date of death
- `InstID`: Assigned institution/facility (represented via BOP's standard three-letter codes)
- `DeathCategory`: One of 35 categories, such as "Cancer", "Drug Overdose", or "Pending Autopsy"
- `ICD10 Prime`: [ICD-10 code](https://www.cms.gov/medicare/coding-billing/icd-10-codes) for the primary cause of death, or "UNK"
- `ICD10 Second`: [ICD-10 code](https://www.cms.gov/medicare/coding-billing/icd-10-codes) for the secondary cause of death, or "UNK"

The deaths date from January 1, 2005 through August 9, 2024.

The data do *not* contain several of the fields we requested, as BOP's response letter indicates (emphasis added):

> Specifically, the BOP does not track the __assigned housing location within the institution, the security level designation, or the institution entry date__ for the time frame you requested. Obtaining that information would require the BOP to conduct an unreasonably burdensome search through the records of each listed adult in custody (AIC).
