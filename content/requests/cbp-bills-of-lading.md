  title: Request Rejected
  body: >-
    On April 28, 2023, CBP [emailed a rejection letter 📄](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23808142-2023-04-28-cbp-foia-cbp-fo-2023-075587), saying that the records are unavailable via FOIA. This statement seems to contradict the evidence, [presented in the request letter](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23790364-2023-04-27-dhscbp-ace-manifest-data-foia-request-singer-vine), that such records have been obtained via FOIA before. The Data Liberation Project is seeking clarity on this matter.

*This request was inspired by conversations with [Mike Schlauch](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-schlauch-94a0061a), a data scientist at [DrivenData](https://drivendata.co/).*


Customs and Border Protection's [Automated Commercial Environment](https://www.cbp.gov/trade/automated) (`ACE`) "is the system through which the trade community reports imports and exports and the government determines admissibility.” 

Of particular interest, `ACE` contains the "bills of lading" (also know as cargo manifests) describing each shipment into and out of the United States.

Per CBP's [privacy impact assessment for ACE](https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/privacy-piaupdate-cbp-ace-july2015.pdf), “as required by 19 U.S.C. § 1431, 46 U.S.C. § 60105, and 19 CFR § 103.31, certain inbound and outbound manifest data in ACE may be made available for publication.” The [first](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2011-title19/html/USCODE-2011-title19-chap4-subtitleIII-partII-sec1431.htm) and [third](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CFR-2009-title19-vol1/pdf/CFR-2009-title19-vol1-sec103-31.pdf) of those cited statutes provide more detail about what aspects of those bills of lading are disclosable to the public.

Such import/export manifest data has a broad range of socially beneficial uses, including investigative journalism, supply chain monitoring, and economic research.

[Our FOIA request 📄](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23790364-2023-04-27-dhscbp-ace-manifest-data-foia-request-singer-vine) to CBP seeks all disclosable data records, from all database tables in `ACE`, documenting inward and outward manifests received by CBP since January 1, 2013.
