  body: >-
    On May 17, 2024, the Data Liberation Project [filed another appeal 📄](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24672058-2024-05-17-appeal-of-dea-foia-22-01101-f-singer-vine), arguing that the exemptions cited in the February 27 denial do not apply to the entirety of the records requested.The appeal has been [assigned tracking number A-2024-01699 📄](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24672059-2024-05-17-appeal-acknowledgment-a-24-01699).

  title: Remanded portion of request denied
  body: >-
    On February 27, 2024, the DEA [declined 📄](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24537677-2024-02-27-determination-appeal-remand) to provide records responsive to the portion of the request remanded by the appeals officer, citing FOIA exemptions 2 and 7(E).

  title: Appeal partly granted
  body: >-
    On February 22, 2024, the Department of Justice sent a [determination letter 📄](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24537676-2024-02-22-a-2023-01489_response) in response to the DLP's appeal. Regarding the data records, the agency upheld the DEA's original determination, arguing that "it would require DEA to conduct an unreasonably burdensome search. Your request is not reasonably described because you did not characterize the records sought in such a way that they could be located without conducting thousands of hours of search." Regarding the documentation records, the appeal determination remanded that portion back to the DEA, asking them to conduct a search for responsive records.

  title: Request Acknowledged, Placed on "Complex Track"
  body: >-
    On September 27, 2022, the DEA [emailed an acknowledgment letter 📄](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23070510-2022-09-27-dea-foia_pa-case-number-22-01101-f-acknowledgment-letter) regarding this request, which has been assigned to the "complex" processing track. "The records you seek require searches in another office or offices, and so your request falls within 'unusual circumstances.' [...] Because of these unusual circumstances, we are extending the time limit to respond to your request beyond the ten additional days provided by the statute. We have not yet completed a search to determine whether there are records within the scope of your request."

The Drug Enforcement Administration [requires](https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/21cfr_reports/theft/index.html) all entities it has authorized to manufacture or handle [controlled substances](https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/schedules/) to inform the agency about any "theft or significant loss of any controlled substance, disposal receptacles or listed chemicals within one business day of discovery of such loss or theft."

Those reports are collected via the DEA's [Theft Loss Reporting (`TLR`) system](https://apps.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/TLR/), which allows registrants to submit the following forms electronically:

- [Form DEA-106](https://deadiversion.usdoj.gov/21cfr_reports/theft/DEA_Form_106.pdf), “Report of Theft or Loss of Controlled Substances,” [OMB Control No. 1117-0001](https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAOMBHistory?ombControlNumber=1117-0001)
- [Form DEA-107](https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/DownloadDocument?objectID=103735201), “Report of Theft or Loss of Listed Chemical,” [OMB Control No. 1117-0024](https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAOMBHistory?ombControlNumber=1117-0024)

According to the agency's filings with Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, the DEA receives [as many as 37,047 submissions of Form DEA-106 annually](https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAViewICR?ref_nbr=202005-1117-002), and [as many as 3,827 for Form DEA-107](https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAViewICR?ref_nbr=202008-1117-005). After an appeal, the DEA provided a [58-page manual describing the TLR](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25589722-dea-theftloss-of-controlled-substances-manual-partially-redacted/), but withheld portions of it citing personnel, privacy and law enforcement exemptions.

To our knowledge, the DEA proactively publishes only highly-aggregated information collected through the `TLR` system. In its [2020 National Drug Threat Assessment report](https://www.dea.gov/sites/default/files/2021-02/DIR-008-21%202020%20National%20Drug%20Threat%20Assessment_WEB.pdf), the DEA notes that more than 6 million dosage units of opioids were reported stolen or lost in 2019 and that two states (Missouri and Arizona) each accounted for more than 2,000 incidents of controlled prescription drugs being lost in transit that year. These figures suggest that the theft and loss of controlled substances and listed chemicals are widespread, and contain important local variations that the DEA’s published reports do not fully capture. 

[Our FOIA request 📄](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22925202-2022-09-23-dojdea-tlr-foia-request) to the DEA seeks all database records collected through the `TLR` system, Form DEA-106, and Form DEA-107 (excluding narrative data fields and data fields that contain personal information about individual persons), plus all relevant database documentation.

The disclosure of these records would allow the public to identify important trends in controlled substance theft/loss that could help identify problems in their communities, as well as to hold the DEA accountable regarding [its responsibility](https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/Inside.html) “to prevent, detect, and investigate the diversion of controlled pharmaceuticals and listed chemicals from legitimate sources[.]”
