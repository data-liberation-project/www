The Family Advocacy Program (FAP) [Child Abuse and Domestic Abuse Incident Reporting System](https://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/DD/issuances/dodi/640001p.pdf) is a Department of Defense database “designed to address prevention, identification, evaluation, treatment, rehabilitation, follow-up, and reporting of child abuse and neglect, domestic abuse, and problematic sexual behavior in children and youth” in military communities. It contains information about each incident, victim, and alleged abuser.

[Our FOIA request 📄](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24017885-2023-10-06-dod-fap-central-registry-data-foia-request-singer-vine) seeks:

- Records from all [tables and fields](https://www.esd.whs.mil/Portals/54/Documents/DD/issuances/dodm/640001m_vol2.pdf) (except personally identifiable fields) in the database.

- All records documenting this database system, including record layouts, database schemas, entity relationship diagrams, database diagrams, data dictionaries, glossaries, and user guides.

Although the Department of Defense publishes [aggregate statistics](https://download.militaryonesource.mil/12038/MOS/Reports/FINAL-DoD-FAP-Report-FY2021.pdf) from the database, the requested records would allow more thorough public analyses of abuse allegations and outcomes.
