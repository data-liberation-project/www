*This request was inspired by a conversation with [Nausheen Husain](https://nausheenhusain.github.io/), a journalist and Syracuse professor who has reported on conditions in federal prisons.*

The Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP)’s [Administrative Remedy Program](https://www.bop.gov/policy/progstat/1330_018.pdf) “allow[s] an inmate to seek formal review of an issue relating to any aspect of his/her own confinement.” 

BOP tracks those complaints through `SENTRY`, the agency's “[primary mission support database](https://oig.justice.gov/sites/default/files/legacy/reports/BOP/a0325/final.pdf)” — specifically, `SENTRY`’s “Administrative Remedy System module,” a component of the system dedicated to tracking such complaints and their follow-up.

Information tracked through the module, also known as “Inmate Administrative Remedy Record System, JUSTICE/BOP-004,” [includes](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2002/09/09/02-22792/privacy-act-of-1974-system-of-records):

> (1) Inmate information including (a) name; (b) register number; (c) institution location; (d) current offense and sentence; (e) prior criminal record; (f) social background; (g) institution adjustment; (h) institution program data; (i) medical information; and (j) personal property data; (2) complaint information including copies of BOP-9's (institution level complaints), BOP-10's (Region appeals) and BOP-11's (Central Office appeals); and (3) processing information, including dates of filing and responses.

[Our FOIA request 📄](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23258047-2022-10-27-dojbop-sentry-administrative-remedy-foia-request) to BOP seeks all database records stored within this module, with the exception of data fields that contain personally-identifiable information, plus all relevant database documentation.
