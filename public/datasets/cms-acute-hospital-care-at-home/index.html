    <div class="post">
        <p>In November 2020, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) <a href="https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cms-announces-comprehensive-strategy-enhance-hospital-capacity-amid-covid-19-surge">announced</a> a new waiver program, called Acute Hospital Care At Home (AHCAH), aimed at “providing eligible hospitals with unprecedented regulatory flexibilities to treat eligible patients in their homes.”</p>
<p>More specifically, <a href="https://qualitynet.cms.gov/acute-hospital-care-at-home">CMS began</a> “accepting waiver requests to waive §482.23(b) and (b)(1) of the Hospital Conditions of Participation, which require nursing services to be provided on premises 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and the immediate availability of a registered nurse for care of any patient.”</p>
<p>Instead, for patients treated through the AHCAH program, “A registered nurse will evaluate each patient once daily either in person or remotely, and two in-person visits will occur daily by either registered nurses or mobile integrated health paramedics, based on the patient’s nursing plan and hospital policies,” according to November 2020 announcement.</p>
<p>This allowed hospitals to receive Medicare (and certain Medicaid) payments for such home care. Per a <a href="https://catalyst.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/CAT.21.0338">NEJM Catalyst article</a> reviewing the program, “This represented the first example of payment for this level of care at home for beneficiaries with Medicare Fee-for-Service (FFS) and — in certain states — non–managed care Medicaid.” (<a href="https://qualitynet.cms.gov/acute-hospital-care-at-home/resources#tab2">According to CMS</a>, “Medicare inpatient payments to a hospital will be the same as they would have been if the care was provided in a traditional inpatient setting.”)</p>
<p>The waiver program is split into two tiers: Tier 1 waivers, available to hospitals that “provided at home acute hospital services to at least 25 patients previously,” and Tier 2 waivers, provided to those that had not. The application for Tier 1 waivers is simpler, and those hospitals have to report their key AHCAH metrics only monthly, rather than weekly.</p>
<p>In order to continue participating in the program, hospitals with AHCAH waivers must submit <a href="https://qualitynet.cms.gov/acute-hospital-care-at-home/measures">weekly/monthly metrics</a> (called “measures”) to CMS, indicating the number of AHCAH patients discharged from the hospital’s care, the number that died unexpectedly, and the number that required “escalation” back into a traditional hospital setting.</p>
<p>When first issued in 2020, waivers were only meant to last for the duration of the <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/coronavirus/covid-19-public-health-emergency/index.html">COVID-19 Public Health Emergency</a> (PHE). The PHE <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/05/09/fact-sheet-end-of-the-covid-19-public-health-emergency.html">officially</a> ended on May 11, 2023. The <a href="https://appropriations.house.gov/sites/democrats.appropriations.house.gov/files/FY23%20Summary%20of%20Appropriations%20Provisions.pdf">2023 Consolidated Appropriations Act</a>, however, <a href="https://www.cmhealthlaw.com/2023/01/hospital-at-home-programs-extended-but-final-push-is-needed/">extended</a> the AHCAH program until December 31, 2024.</p>
<p>On January 27, 2023, the Data Liberation Project (DLP) — in collaboration with researcher <a href="https://maddy.zone/">Maddy Varner</a>, then a journalist at The Markup — <a href="https://www.data-liberation-project.org/requests/cms-acute-hospital-care-at-home/">filed a FOIA request to CMS</a>, seeking all database records representing AHCAH waiver requests received by CMS (and the agency’s processing of those requests), all AHCAH reporting measures submitted by hospitals (with the exception of patient-identifiable information), and all database documentation relevant to those records.</p>
<p>On June 26, 2023, CMS provided a response to the DLP’s FOIA request. It contained four CSV spreadsheets, corresponding to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tier 1 waiver requests (undated, but likely through mid/late April, 2023)</li>
<li>Tier 2 waiver requests (undated, but likely through mid/late April, 2023)</li>
<li>Tier 1 reporting measures (through March 2023)</li>
<li>Tier 2 reporting measures (through the week of April 10–16, 2023)</li>
</ul>
<p>On October 2, 2023, CMS provided an updated set of records — all waiver requests and reporting measures submitted through September 14, 2023 — with several improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each set of records now contains a Status and Created column, reflecting the waiver/measure status and the date the entry was created.</li>
<li>The new release fixes an issue with the prior release, in which Measure 1c was missing for Tier 1 hospitals’ reported measures.</li>
<li>A series of internal identifiers, which had led the Data Liberation Project to release only a (lightly) redacted version of the previous files, have been removed; the raw files in the new release are available to the public in full.</li>
</ul>
