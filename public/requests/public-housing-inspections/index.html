    <div class="post">
        <p>Among its many responsibilities, the Department of Housing and Urban Development oversees public housing in the United States. Although most logistics are handled by the nation&rsquo;s thousands of local <a href="https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/public_indian_housing/pha/contacts">public housing authorities</a>, HUD&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/public_indian_housing/reac">Real Estate Assessment Center</a> coordinates the <a href="https://www.hud.gov/topics/REAC_Inspections/">physical inspections of all public housing properties</a>.</p>
<p>These inspections <a href="https://www.hud.gov/topics/REAC_Inspections/residents">aim to assess</a> whether the properties are &ldquo;decent, safe, and sanitary.&rdquo; They are supposed to be conducted by professional, independent inspectors every 1-3 years (with lower-performing properties inspected more often than higher-scoring properties) and are distinct from the routine inspections a building manager or local government might conduct. Inspectors <a href="https://www.hud.gov/sites/documents/appendix2-finaldictionary.pdf">examine</a> the property site, building exteriors, building systems (e.g., heating system, elevators), common areas, and a selection of housing units. A list of the most common deficiencies can be found <a href="https://apps.hud.gov/offices/reac/products/pass/top20.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p>The results of every inspection are collected via a tool called RAPID and fed into the agency&rsquo;s Physical Assessment Subsystem Server. <a href="https://www.hud.gov/sites/documents/rapid4.0userguide.pdf">Per HUD</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>RAPID is a tool utilized by inspectors to record &amp; process inspection data. The software downloads Inspection Data from the server, record/update Inspection Profile, Property Profile, Participants Profile, Certificates, Building Profile and records observations in the Building System, Building Exteriors, Common Areas and Units. Once all inspectable areas are completed, users can upload the completed inspection to the Physical Assessment Subsystem Server to be process[ed], reviewed, scored and released to Multifamily or PHAS.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, HUD releases very limited information about the results of the inspections â€” <a href="https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/pis.html">only top-level scores</a>, as far as we can tell. But public housing residents and other members of the public deserve to know much more.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22925204-2022-09-23-hud-phaspass-foia-request">Our FOIA request ðŸ“„</a> to HUD seeks all database records in the Physical Assessment Subsystem (excluding data fields containing personally identifying information), plus all relevant database documentation.</p>

    <b>Appeal Filed Re. Constructive Denial</b> â€¢ On March 20, 2023, the Cornell Law School First Amendment Clinic <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23718313-2023-03-20-appeal-re-foia-22-fi-hq-01969">sent HUD a letter appealing the &ldquo;constructive denial&rdquo; of this request</a>, based on the agency&rsquo;s undue delays. &ldquo;This appeal is necessary because HUD has not issued a determination within either 20 working days of receipt of the Request or the 10-working-day maximum extension provided for under 5 U.S.C. Â§ 552(a)(6)(B)(i). [&hellip;] HUD has not yet issued any determination of whether it will grant the Request. Neither has HUD plausibly set forth any &lsquo;unusual circumstances&rsquo; that would have justified a ten-working-day extension under 5 U.S.C. Â§ 552(a)(6)(B)(i), much less any &lsquo;exceptional circumstances&rsquo; under which a court may allow HUD additional time to complete its review under 5 U.S.C. Â§ 552(a)(6)(C)(i).&rdquo; HUD has assigned the appeal tracking number 23-A-HQ-00026.

    <b>Request Acknowledged</b> â€¢ On September 29, 2022, HUD <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23114626-2022-09-29-22-01969-acknowledgment-and-initial-fee-letter">emailed an acknowledgment letter ðŸ“„</a> regarding this request. The letter notes: &ldquo;The Department is in the process of making a determination on fees. Once we receive a search back from the program area, we will inform you of the fee waiver decision.&rdquo;
