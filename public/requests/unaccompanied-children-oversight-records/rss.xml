The Data Liberation Project is examining, documenting, and processing the records for public release.</description>

      <title>Scope of Request Narrowed</title>

      <description>Over a series of emails with ACF in early 2023, the Data Liberation Project agreed in mid-March to a narrowing of the scope of the request, focusing just on forms entered via the &amp;ldquo;UC Portal&amp;rdquo; since the portal&amp;rsquo;s creation in 2014. This should include forms corresponding to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAViewICR?ref_nbr=202109-0970-014&#34;&gt;OMB 0970-0547&lt;/a&gt; (A-9, A-10A, A-10B, A-10C, and A-10D), but exclude forms corresponding to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAViewICR?ref_nbr=202112-0970-003&#34;&gt;OMB 0970-0564&lt;/a&gt; (M-1, M-3A, M-3B, M-5A, and M-5B). According to the agency, requesting the latter would &amp;ldquo;[add] a significant amount of work/burden for our entire team to pull/extract, as all these forms are not in the UC Portal or any other database, and are saved/located several places electronically, including [Office of Refugee Resettlement] resource email accounts.&amp;rdquo;</description>
