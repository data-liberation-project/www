        <p>The <a href="https://www.acf.hhs.gov/orr">Office of Refugee Resettlement</a> (ORR), part of the <a href="https://www.acf.hhs.gov/">Administration for Children &amp; Families</a> (ACF), is <a href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/uac-program-fact-sheet.pdf">officially responsible</a> for the care of every unaccompanied child, &ldquo;defined as a child who has no lawful immigration status in the United States; has not attained 18 years of age; and, with respect to whom, there is no parent or legal guardian in the United States, or no parent or legal guardian in the United States available to provide care and physical custody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>ORR monitors the care facilities it funds, and also requires those facilities to submit paperwork when certain types of incidents occur.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23258062-2022-10-28-hhsacforr-uc-incident-and-site-compliance-foia-request">Our FOIA request 📄</a> to ACF seeks all records collected through ten particular forms, from two <a href="https://www.reginfo.gov/public/jsp/PRA/praDashboard.myjsp">OMB-approved</a> &ldquo;information collection&rdquo; packages, with the exception of personally-identifiable information:</p>
<p>From <a href="https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAViewICR?ref_nbr=202109-0970-014">OMB 0970-0547</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Event (Form A-9)</strong>: &ldquo;This instrument is used by ORR care provider programs to document high-level information about situations that must be reported to ORR.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Emergency Significant Incident Report (SIR) and Addendum (Form A-10A)</strong>: &ldquo;This instrument is used by ORR care provider programs to inform ORR of urgent situations in which there is an immediate threat to a child’s safety and well-being that require instantaneous action.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Significant Incident Report (SIR) and Addendum (Form A-10B)</strong>: &ldquo;This instrument is used by ORR care provider programs to inform ORR of situations that affect, but do not immediately threaten, the safety and well-being of a child.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Sexual Abuse Significant Incident Report (SA/SIR) and Addendum (Form A-10C)</strong>: &ldquo;This instrument is used by ORR care provider programs to inform ORR of allegations of sexual harassment, sexual abuse, and inappropriate sexual behavior that occurred while the UC was in ORR custody.&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>Program-Level Event (PLE) Report and Addendum (Form A-10D)</strong>: &ldquo;This instrument is used by ORR care provider programs to inform ORR of events that may affect the entire care provider facility, such as an active shooter or natural disaster.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>From <a href="https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAViewICR?ref_nbr=202112-0970-003">OMB 0970-0564</a> (<em>Please see update below re. the narrowing of this request&rsquo;s scope</em>):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Corrective Action Report (Form M-1)</strong>: &ldquo;This instrument is used by ORR Monitoring Team staff (includes Federal and contractor staff), ORR Federal Field Specialists, and ORR Project Officers to document care provider non-compliance with minimum standards for the care and timely release of UC; Federal and State Laws and regulations; licensing standards; ORR policies and procedures; and child welfare standards.&rdquo;</li>

        <ul class="updates-list">
        
           <li class="update-item" id="update-records-published">
    <b>Records Published</b> • On October 12, 2023, the Data Liberation Project <a href="https://www.data-liberation-project.org/datasets/unaccompanied-children-oversight-records">published the records received</a> through this request, along with <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ch1_yS5bD5F7iyJakLFX7UAZMj0U9X1Dh4mNDMA9-UE/edit">documentation</a> and a note about the DLP&rsquo;s concerns about the records&rsquo; completeness.
</li>

        
           <li class="update-item" id="update-records-provided-dlp-processing">
    <b>Records Provided, DLP Processing</b> • On September 7, 2023, ACF completed its provision of the records requested (per the narrowed scope), in the form of a series of spreadsheets, each representing a table in the UC Portal. The Data Liberation Project is examining, documenting, and processing the records for public release.
</li>

        
           <li class="update-item" id="update-estimated-date-of-completion-provided">
    <b>Estimated Date of Completion Provided</b> • On April 3, 2023, ACF provided an estimated completion date of April 26, 2023. “However, as stated in the acknowledgement letter sent to you on November 11, 2022, ‘the actual processing time will depend on the complexity of your request and whether sensitive records, voluminous records, extensive search, and/or consultation with other HHS components or other executive branch agencies are involved.’“
</li>

        
           <li class="update-item" id="update-scope-of-request-narrowed">
    <b>Scope of Request Narrowed</b> • Over a series of emails with ACF in early 2023, the Data Liberation Project agreed in mid-March to a narrowing of the scope of the request, focusing just on forms entered via the &ldquo;UC Portal&rdquo; since the portal&rsquo;s creation in 2014. This should include forms corresponding to <a href="https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAViewICR?ref_nbr=202109-0970-014">OMB 0970-0547</a> (A-9, A-10A, A-10B, A-10C, and A-10D), but exclude forms corresponding to <a href="https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/PRAViewICR?ref_nbr=202112-0970-003">OMB 0970-0564</a> (M-1, M-3A, M-3B, M-5A, and M-5B). According to the agency, requesting the latter would &ldquo;[add] a significant amount of work/burden for our entire team to pull/extract, as all these forms are not in the UC Portal or any other database, and are saved/located several places electronically, including [Office of Refugee Resettlement] resource email accounts.&rdquo;
