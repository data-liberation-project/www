    <div class="post">
        <p>The Department of Homeland Security&rsquo;s Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) provides two main types of assistance to people affected by major disasters: financial assistance and &ldquo;direct housing&rdquo; assistance.</p>
<p>Receiving direct housing assistance means that FEMA acquires and provides a temporary place for you to live. The main options for direct housing are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recreational Vehicles</li>
<li>Manufactured Housing Units</li>
<li>Multi-Family Lease and Repair</li>
<li>Direct Lease</li>
<li>Permanent Housing Construction</li>
</ul>
<p>For more details about each option, see Table 1 of <a href="https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-07/Direct_Housing_Guide_Feb2020.pdf">FEMA&rsquo;s Direct Housing Guide</a> (February 2020). For further context, see the Congressional Research Service&rsquo;s <a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R46014/8">overview of FEMA&rsquo;s individual assistance programs</a>.</p>
<p>FEMA tracks its direct housing operations through its <strong>Housing Operations Management
Enterprise System (<code>HOMES</code>)</strong>, which the <a href="https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-07/Direct_Housing_Guide_Feb2020.pdf">Direct Housing Guide</a> calls &ldquo;the Direct Housing system of record.&rdquo; <code>HOMES</code> is a component of of FEMA&rsquo;s National Emergency Management Information System (<code>NEMIS</code>), and specifically <code>NEMIS</code>&rsquo;s &ldquo;Individual Assistance&rdquo; subsystem, <code>NEMIS-IA</code>.</p>
<p>The Data Liberation Project has been unable to locate public documentation concerning the specific structure of <code>HOMES</code> or a comprehensive accounting of the fields it contains. But the <a href="https://www.fema.gov/sites/default/files/2020-07/Direct_Housing_Guide_Feb2020.pdf">Direct Housing Guide</a> describes some aspects of it. For instance, <code>HOMES</code> appears to track:</p>
<ul>
<li>Information about <strong>applicants</strong> eligible for direct housing assistance, including a large amount of information that is personally-identifiable and potentially sensitive.</li>
<li>The selection, inspection, and development of potential <strong>sites</strong> for direct housing.</li>
<li>The <strong>progress</strong> installing temporary housing units, and preparing them for occupancy.</li>
<li>Occupant <strong>move-in and move-out</strong> dates.</li>
</ul>
<p>To our knowledge, vanishingly little data from <code>HOMES</code> is available to the public.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22925200-2022-09-23-dhsfema-homes-foia-request">Our FOIA request 📄</a> to FEMA seeks all database records stored in <code>HOMES</code> (excluding data fields containing personally identifying information), plus all relevant database documentation.</p>
<p>The release of this data would shed invaluable light on a core component of FEMA&rsquo;s response to major disasters, which journalists and watchdogs have criticized. (See, for instance, recent coverage in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/23/climate/climate-disaster-relief-fema.html">The New York Times</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/10/17/disaster-survivors-fema-housing-trailer/">The Washington Post</a>.)</p>
<p>The records could also clarify how well the system itself is working, another issue of potential concern. As a <a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-20-503.pdf">2020 report by the Government Accountability Office</a> noted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[&hellip;] program officials said this system—which is FEMA’s system of record for tracking direct temporary housing assistance—lacks controls; is inconsistently used by field staff; and has incomplete information, contributing to information-sharing challenges.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even if inconsistencies and incompleteness ultimately prevent certain types of analysis, the public deserves to understand the specific nature of those problems.</p>
