        <p>In November 2022, the <a href="https://www.data-liberation-project.org/">Data Liberation Project</a> sent the Department of Agriculture <a href="../../requests/usda-food-purchases/">a request</a> for data from â€” and documentation of â€” the agency&rsquo;s Web Based Supply Chain Management System (<code>WBSCM</code>), which it uses for coordinating the purchase and distribution of federal food and commodity orders.</p>
<p>In conversations with the Data Liberation Project, the agency said it was unable to export the data records requested; the Data Liberation Project agreed to re-focus the request on the documentation records. The agency <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23941261-2023-09-01-2023-ams-00030-f-final-response-letter">initially refused to provide those records</a>, citing FOIA exemptions 3 and 7(E). After the Data Liberation Project <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24178295-2023-11-28-appeal-re-ams-foia-request-2023-ams-00030-f">appealed this decision</a> (with the assistance of the Cornell Law School First Amendment Clinic), the USDA has begun to provide the records.</p>
